# skel_disk_graph_roadmap
Python implementation of the Skeleton-Disk-Graph Roadmap (SDGRM) planner.

The SDGRM planner is a deterministic roadmap, focused on safety and sparsity. Its principle is to rely on the occupancy data as input, computing the associated Signed Distance Field (SDF), from which a skeleton of the environment can be extracted.
The skeleton is then sampled to place free-space bubbles which serve as the roadmap nodes; using such bubbles makes the distribution of the final roadmap nodes non-uniform and naturally adapted to local conditions (the nodes density is higher in areas of low SDF, i.e. close to the obstacles).
